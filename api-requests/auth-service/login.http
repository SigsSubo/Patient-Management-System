# when not using api gateway POST http://localhost:4005/login
# changes made: to auth service - removed bind ports, since we want it to be handled by api gateway.
# when doing so: if POST http://localhost:4005/login, we get connection refused as that port is no longer used.
# POST http://localhost:4004/auth/login works since its pointing to api-gateway.
