DTOs are lightweight objects used to transfer data between different parts of an application, improving performance by reducing the amount of data exchanged and enhancing security by controlling data exposure.

➡️Benefits of Using DTOs for Data Exchange

DTOs help prevent over-fetching or under-fetching of data, reduce network traffic, improve API responses, and enhance code maintainability and readability in applications where data transfer is frequent.

📌Summary
Entity: Found at the Database Layer, it's the direct representation of your data.
Model: Located in the Service Layer, it processes and prepares data for various application needs.
DTO: Positioned in the Web Layer, it streamlines data transfer, ensuring efficient communication between systems.
